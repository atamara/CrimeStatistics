# Initial scatter plot shows an extremely high correlation between 
# increased population and increased total hate crimes.

# Correlation Test - Calculating Correlation Values
#  First, test Assumption of Normality on both continuous variables.
plotNormalHistogram(HateCrime02$Population)
# Population variable is extremely positively skewed - not Normal.
plotNormalHistogram(HateCrime02$TotalCrimes)
# Total Crimes variable is also extremely positively skewed - not Normal.
# Proceed with Spearman's Rho Correlation Test for Non-Normal data.
cor.test(HateCrime02$TotalCrimes, HateCrime02$Population, method="spearman", use = "complete.obs")
# Results: p-value of < 2.2e-16 indicates correlation is extremely significant.
# Rho Coefficient at 0.3390968 indicates moderate positive correlation.

# Alternatively, if a Pearson's Test were to be run, the variables would have
# to be transformed to Normal Distributions.
# Population Variable:
plotNormalHistogram(HateCrime02$Population)
# Extremely positively skewed variable must be transformed.
plotNormalHistogram(sqrt(HateCrime02$Population))
plotNormalHistogram(log(HateCrime02$Population))
plotNormalHistogram(transformTukey(HateCrime02$Population))
# Tukey's shows most Normal Distribution - creating transformed variable.
HateCrime02$PopulationT <- transformTukey(HateCrime02$Population)
# Total Crimes Variable:
plotNormalHistogram(HateCrime02$TotalCrimes)
# Extremely positively skewed variable must be transformed.
plotNormalHistogram(sqrt(HateCrime02$TotalCrimes))
plotNormalHistogram(log(HateCrime02$TotalCrimes))
plotNormalHistogram(log2(HateCrime02$TotalCrimes))
plotNormalHistogram(transformTukey(HateCrime02$TotalCrimes))
# Tukey's shows most Normal Distribution - creating transformed variable.
HateCrime02$TotalCrimesT <- transformTukey(HateCrime02$TotalCrimes)
# Proceed with Pearson's Correlation Test.
cor.test(HateCrime02$TotalCrimesT, HateCrime02$PopulationT, method="pearson", use = "complete.obs")
# Results: p-value of < 2.2e-16 indicates correlation is extremely significant.
# Correlation Coefficient at 0.412559 indicates moderate positive correlation.
# Therefore, if both variables are adjusted to Normal Distributions, there is
# still a moderate positive correlation between high population and high
# occurrence of hate crimes.

# Correlation Matrices - Assessing Different Types of Hate Crimes
HCTypes0 <- HateCrime02[, c(5,6,7,8,9,10,15)]
View(HCTypes0)
# Again, Spearman Method is used because the Population variable does not have 
# a naturally-occurring Normal Distribution.
chart.Correlation(HCTypes0, histogram=FALSE, method="spearman")
# These results may also be presented in a Correlation Matrix Table.
HCTypesTable0 <- cor(HCTypes0)
View(HCTypesTable0)
# Results:
# # High population areas show a strong correlation with hate crimes motivated by
# Religion, with the highest coefficient at 0.82545736; moderate correlations with
# Sexual Orientation, Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry, and Gender Identification; a weak 
# correlation with Disability; and no correlation with Gender.

# Computing Linear Regression
HCLinReg0 <- lm(TotalCrimes ~ Population, HateCrime02)
print(HCLinReg0)
# In this case, y = 0.0000469x - 0.1153296
# Summarizing Calculation:
summary(HCLinReg0)
# Results: p-value at < 2.2e-16 shows extremely high significance.
# Adjusted R-squared value is 0.0.5801 , which means Population can explain  
# 58.01% of the factors that contribute to occurrence of hate crimes. Therefore,
# population and hate crime occurrence are fairly closely related.

# Making Predictions:
# If, for example, one wanted to predict the number of hate crimes that would
# likely occur in a city of 200,000 people, based on data from 2019, the 
# equation would work as follows:
# y = 0.0000469(200000) - 0.1153296 , which equals: 
# 9.2646704 -- i.e., 9 total hate crimes.

# Unfortunately, this does not account for the number of hate crimes that may
# go unreported.
