# coefficients with 2nd Amendment-Friendly States and Percentage of Gun
# Ownership, at 0.6603713 and 0.5036238, respectively.
# This shows that there is a significant correlative relationship among Red

# Correlation Matrices - Assessing Different Types of Hate Crimes with 
# Independent Variables
RedTypes4 <- HateCrimeRed1[, c(10,17,18,19,20,21,22,12,13,11,14,15)]      
View(RedTypes4)
# Again, Spearman Method is used because many variables do not have 
# a naturally-occurring Normal Distribution.
chart.Correlation(RedTypes4, histogram=FALSE, method="spearman")
# These results may also be presented in a Correlation Matrix Table.
RedTypesTable4 <- cor(RedTypes4)
View(RedTypesTable4)
# Values shown in table are sufficiently in line with correlation test results.

# Creating Correlation Matrix Plot
corrplot(RedTypesTable4, type="lower", order="hclust", p.mat = RedTypesTable4, sig.level = 0.01, insig="blank")
# Correlation Matrix Plot confirms all negative correlations among Hate Crime
# Type Variables and Red State Attribute Variables (including Death Penalty,
# 2nd Amendment-Friendly, and Gun Ownership Percentage).

# Conclusion :
# Assessing correlation matrices confirms initial hypothesis that the 
# majority of hate crime occurrences, even when broken down by type, are 
# significantly lower in Red States than Blue States.
# This trend continues even when Red States are considered in by individual
# variables of Death Penalty, 2nd Amendment-Friendly, and 
# Gun Ownership Percentage.

# Once again, these findings dramatically refute the common popular bias that 
# Republican voters are more likely to show 'hateful' tendencies toward certain 
# groups, and/or are more likely to commit hate crimes.
